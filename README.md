# Quantum Data Alignment Simulation (Bell State)

This project contains a simple Python script that uses **Qiskit** to demonstrate a fundamental concept in quantum computing: **Quantum Data Alignment** through the creation of a maximally entangled state (the $|\Phi^+\rangle$ Bell state).

The simulation shows how applying a **Hadamard gate** (superposition) and a **CNOT gate** (entanglement) results in a perfect correlation between two qubits, where the measured outcomes are *always* `00` or `11`, never `01` or `10`. This perfect correlation is the essence of quantum data alignment.
